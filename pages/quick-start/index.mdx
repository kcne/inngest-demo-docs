# Quick Start

Ready to build with Inngest? This comprehensive guide takes you from your first "Hello World" function to production-ready workflows, covering local development setup, common usage patterns, deployment strategies, and scaling considerations. Whether you prefer hands-on learning or need specific solutions, you'll understand not just how to use Inngest, but when and why to apply different patterns for maximum reliability and performance.

## Getting Started Quickly

The fastest way to understand Inngest is to see it in action. This section gets you from zero to a working function in minutes, then shows you how to progressively add more sophisticated features as your needs grow.

### 5-Minute Setup

Get Inngest running locally with a complete development environment. This setup includes the Inngest Dev Server for visual debugging, a sample function that demonstrates core concepts, and testing tools to verify everything works correctly.

```bash
# 1. Install Inngest
npm install inngest

# 2. Start Inngest Dev Server  
npx inngest-cli dev

# 3. Create your first function
```

```typescript
// app/inngest/functions.ts
import { inngest } from "./client";

export const helloWorld = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "hello-world" },
  { event: "demo/hello" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    console.log(`Hello ${event.data.name}!`);
    return { message: "Hello World!" };
  }
);
```

```typescript
// app/api/inngest/route.ts (Next.js)
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "@/inngest/client";
import { helloWorld } from "@/inngest/functions";

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [helloWorld]
});
```

**Test your setup:**
```bash
# Send an event to trigger your function
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/inngest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "demo/hello", "data": {"name": "World"}}'

# View execution in dashboard: http://localhost:8288
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

  **Local Dev Tip: Use the Inngest Dev Server**
  The Inngest Dev Server (`npx inngest-cli dev`) is your best friend during local development. It provides a visual dashboard (usually at `http://localhost:8288`) where you can see incoming events, inspect their payloads, observe function executions step-by-step, and view logs. This makes debugging and understanding your workflows much easier!

### Progressive Learning Path

Start with simple patterns and gradually introduce more sophisticated features. This progression mirrors how most developers naturally adopt Inngest - beginning with basic background processing and evolving toward complex, resilient workflows.

**1. Background Job** - Move heavy work out of API requests

Replace slow, blocking operations with fast, async event-driven processing. This fundamental pattern improves user experience by keeping API responses fast while ensuring work gets done reliably in the background.

**Key Benefit:** Immediately improves API responsiveness and user experience by offloading time-consuming tasks.

```typescript
// When user signs up → send welcome email asynchronously
{ event: "user/signup" } → sendWelcomeEmail()
```

**2. Multi-Step Workflow** - Add durability with [Steps](/concepts/steps)

Break complex operations into resumable pieces that survive failures. Each step creates a checkpoint, so if something goes wrong, only the failed step retries while successful work is preserved.

**Key Benefit:** Makes your background processes resilient to failures, preventing data loss or incomplete operations by ensuring workflows can resume.

```typescript
await step.run("create-user", () => db.users.create(data));
await step.run("send-email", () => emailService.send(...));
await step.run("track-signup", () => analytics.track(...));
```

**3. Delayed Processing** - Add time-based logic

Introduce delays, schedules, and timeouts to your workflows. This enables complex user journeys, follow-up sequences, and time-sensitive business logic that spans hours, days, or weeks.

**Key Benefit:** Enables long-running, stateful workflows that can react to timelines, such as drip campaigns, trial expirations, or scheduled follow-ups.

```typescript
await step.sleep("wait-24-hours", "24h");
await step.run("send-follow-up", () => sendFollowUp(...));
```

**4. Production Scale** - Add [Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)

Protect your infrastructure and external services with concurrency limits, rate limiting, and batching. These controls ensure your functions scale gracefully without overwhelming downstream systems.

**Key Benefit:** Ensures your application remains stable, cost-effective, and well-behaved at scale by preventing overload on your system and third-party services.

```typescript
{
  concurrency: { limit: 10 },
  rateLimit: { limit: 100, period: "1h" }
}
```

## Common Use Cases

Understanding when and why to use Inngest helps you identify opportunities in your existing applications. These patterns solve real problems that most applications face as they grow and become more complex.

### Background Processing

**When to use**: Heavy operations that don't need immediate user feedback and would slow down API responses if executed synchronously.

**Key Advantages with Inngest:**
*   **Improved User Experience**: APIs respond instantly by offloading work.
*   **Simplified Infrastructure**: No need to manage separate queue systems or worker fleets.
*   **Built-in Reliability**: Automatic retries and state persistence for background tasks.
*   **Easy Deployment**: Functions deploy with your application code.

Background processing is often the first Inngest pattern developers adopt because it provides immediate user experience improvements. Instead of making users wait for slow operations like image processing or email sending, you can respond instantly and handle the work asynchronously.

**Common Examples:**
- **Image/video processing**: Resize, optimize, or analyze uploaded media
- **Data export generation**: Create CSV/PDF reports from large datasets  
- **Third-party API synchronization**: Push data to external services like CRMs
- **Analytics event processing**: Track user behavior without slowing requests

**Start with**: [User onboarding example](/quick-start/examples#user-onboarding-sequence) or [Background Jobs Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/background-jobs)

### Workflow Orchestration

**When to use**: Multi-step processes with dependencies, complex error handling requirements, and business logic that spans multiple systems or time periods.

**Key Advantages with Inngest:**
*   **Durable State Management**: Workflows can pause, wait for external events (`step.waitForEvent()`), sleep (`step.sleep()`), and resume exactly where they left off, even across deployments or failures.
*   **Complex Logic Made Simple**: Write straightforward code for sophisticated sequences, error handling, and compensation logic without manual state machines.
*   **Observability**: Visual timelines in the Dev Server and Inngest Cloud make it easy to understand and debug workflow state.
*   **Modularity**: Break down large processes into smaller, manageable, and testable Inngest functions using `step.invoke()`.

Workflow orchestration becomes essential as your application grows beyond simple CRUD operations. Order processing, content moderation, and user onboarding all require coordinating multiple services while handling failures gracefully.

**Common Examples:**
- **Order processing**: Payment → inventory check → shipping → confirmation
- **Content moderation**: AI analysis → human review → publication decision
- **Employee onboarding**: Account creation → training assignment → access provisioning
- **Data pipeline**: Ingestion → transformation → validation → storage

**Start with**: [Order processing example](/quick-start/examples#e-commerce-order-processing) or [Multi-Step Functions Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multi-step-functions)

### Scheduled Tasks

**When to use**: Recurring operations, maintenance tasks, or time-based triggers that need to run reliably without manual intervention, replacing traditional cron jobs.

**Key Advantages with Inngest:**
*   **Enhanced Reliability**: Built-in retries, error handling, and `onFailure` hooks, superior to standard cron.
*   **Observability**: Scheduled function executions are logged and visible in the Inngest dashboard.
*   **Integrated with Application Logic**: Can easily call other application services or Inngest functions as part of the scheduled task.
*   **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports standard cron expressions.

Scheduled tasks replace traditional cron jobs with more robust, observable, and maintainable solutions. Unlike cron, Inngest scheduled functions have built-in retry logic, logging, and can integrate with your existing application logic.

**Common Examples:**
- **Daily/weekly reports**: Generate and distribute analytics summaries
- **Subscription billing cycles**: Process recurring payments and renewals
- **Data cleanup and archival**: Remove expired records or move old data
- **Health checks and monitoring**: Verify system status and alert on issues

**Start with**: [Cron patterns in Functions](/concepts/functions#scheduled-functions) or [Scheduled Functions Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/scheduled-functions)

### Event-Driven Integration

**When to use**: Reacting to external systems (e.g., webhooks from Stripe, GitHub), user actions, or internal system changes that require immediate response or coordination between multiple services.

**Key Advantages with Inngest:**
*   **Decoupled Systems**: Services communicate via events, making them more maintainable and allowing new functionality to be added without changing existing event producers.
*   **Real-time Responsiveness**: Functions trigger immediately in response to events.
*   **Simplified Webhook Handling**: Easily create reliable handlers for incoming webhooks from third-party services, with Inngest managing retries and state.
*   **Audit Trails**: Events naturally create an audit trail of significant actions in your system.

Event-driven integration becomes crucial for building responsive, decoupled systems that can react to changes in real time. This pattern enables you to build systems that respond intelligently to user behavior and external system changes.

**Common Examples:**
- **Webhook processing**: Handle notifications from Stripe, GitHub, Slack, etc.
- **Cross-system synchronization**: Keep multiple databases or services in sync
- **Real-time notifications**: Send alerts based on user activity or system events
- **Audit trail generation**: Log important actions for compliance or debugging

**Start with**: [Event patterns documentation](/concepts/events#event-patterns) or [Webhook Handling Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/handling-webhooks) (if a general guide exists)

## Production Considerations

Moving from development to production requires careful planning around security, monitoring, and operational practices. These considerations ensure your Inngest functions are reliable, secure, and maintainable at scale.

### Before You Deploy

**Security Best Practices**

Security should be built into your Inngest functions from the beginning. Proper security practices protect both your data and your users while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

- **Set up [signing keys](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/signing-keys)**: Authenticate requests between Inngest and your app
- **Protect sensitive data**: Never include passwords, API keys, or personal information in [event](/concepts/events) payloads
- **Use environment variables**: Store secrets securely and access them in your functions
- **Validate input data**: Always validate event payloads and external API responses

<Callout type="error" emoji="🔒">
  **Critical Security Reminder: Manage Secrets Securely**
  NEVER hardcode secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.) directly in your function code or commit them to version control. Always use environment variables to store sensitive information and access them within your functions (e.g., `process.env.API_KEY`). Utilize your deployment platform's secret management capabilities.
</Callout>

**Monitoring and Observability**

Comprehensive monitoring helps you identify issues before they impact users and provides the data needed for optimization and scaling decisions.

<Callout type="info" emoji="📝">
  **Logging Best Practice: Use Structured Logs**
  When logging within your Inngest functions (e.g., using the provided `logger` object or your own logging library), prefer structured logging (e.g., JSON format). Include relevant context like `eventId`, `runId`, `stepName`, and key business identifiers (`orderId`, `userId`). This makes your logs much easier to search, filter, and analyze in your observability platform, significantly speeding up debugging.
</Callout>

- **Configure [Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)**: Set appropriate limits to protect external services and manage costs

**Testing Strategy**

Thorough testing builds confidence in your functions and prevents issues in production. Test both happy paths and error scenarios to ensure robust behavior.

- **Unit test function logic**: Test business logic in isolation ([testing patterns](/quick-start/patterns#testing-functions))
- **Integration test workflows**: Verify end-to-end behavior with the Inngest Test Engine
- **Test error scenarios**: Ensure proper handling of failures, timeouts, and invalid data
- **Validate schemas**: Confirm event structure and function contracts are consistent

### Deployment Workflow

A smooth deployment process reduces risk and enables rapid iteration. This workflow ensures your functions are properly deployed and synchronized with the Inngest platform.

**1. Local Development**

Develop and test your functions locally with instant feedback and visual debugging tools.

```bash
npx inngest-cli dev  # Start Inngest Dev Server with visual dashboard
npm run dev          # Start your application server
```

**2. Deploy Your Application**

Deploy your application to your preferred platform. Inngest functions deploy as part of your regular application deployment.

```bash
# Deploy to your platform (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.)
npm run deploy
```

**3. Sync with Inngest**

Register your functions with Inngest Cloud so events can trigger them in production.

```bash
# Automatic with platform integrations or manual sync:
curl -X PUT https://your-app.com/api/inngest
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Hits

Common issues and their solutions to get you unstuck quickly. These solutions address the most frequent problems developers encounter when building with Inngest.

| Symptom                                                        | Common Causes & Solutions                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function Not Triggering**                                    | - **Event Name Mismatch**: Double-check `event` name spelling and structure in both the event sender and the function trigger. <br/> - **Function Not Registered**: Verify the function is correctly included in your `serve()` handler configuration and that the Inngest API route is deployed. <br/> - **Sync Issues**: Ensure your app has been successfully synced with Inngest Cloud after deployment (e.g., `curl -X PUT https://YOUR_APP_URL/api/inngest`). Check the Inngest dashboard for registration status. |
| **Steps Not Working Properly / Function Restarts from Start**  | - **Missing `step.run()` Wrappers**: Ensure all asynchronous operations, external API calls, or any code that might fail and needs to be retried are wrapped in a `step.run(\"unique-step-name\", async () => { ... })`. <br/> - **Non-Deterministic Code**: Logic that produces different outputs given the same input (e.g., using `Math.random()` or `new Date()` directly to determine step behavior) should be handled carefully. If such values are needed by steps, generate them *within* a step to ensure they are memoized. <br/> - **Duplicate Step Names**: All step names within a single function execution must be unique. If you have loops or conditional logic generating steps, ensure unique names (e.g., `step.run('process-item-[ITEM_ID]', ...)`). |
| **Performance Issues (Slow Execution, High Costs)**            | - **Missing Flow Control**: Review [Flow Control settings](/concepts/flow-control) (concurrency, rate limits, batching) to ensure they are appropriate for your function\'s interaction with downstream services. <br/> - **Inefficient Step Logic**: Analyze if too many small, granular steps are adding unnecessary overhead. Sometimes, grouping a few related, quick operations into a single step can be more efficient. <br/> - **Sequential Execution Bottlenecks**: If your function has multiple independent operations, consider using `step.parallel()` to run them concurrently. |

<Callout type="info" emoji="🛠️">
  **General Debugging Tip: Leverage the Dev Server & Logs**
  - **Inngest Dev Server**: When developing locally (`npx inngest-cli dev`), the Dev Server dashboard (`http://localhost:8288`) is your first stop. It shows event streams, function run timelines (including step inputs/outputs), and logs.
  - **Verbose Logging**: Temporarily add more detailed logging within your function and steps during development to trace execution flow and variable states.
  - **Check `onFailure`**: If functions are failing completely, ensure you have an `onFailure` handler to catch and log terminal errors for better diagnosis.
