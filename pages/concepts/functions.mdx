# Functions

Functions are where your business logic lives in Inngest. Write them like regular TypeScript functions, and Inngest automatically handles the complex workflow orchestration - [retries](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries), [state persistence](https://www.inngest.com/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed#state-persistance), [error handling](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/error-handling), and [scaling](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control). Think of them as **smart functions** that respond to [Events](/concepts/events) and can pause, wait, and recover from failures without losing progress, embodying the principles of [Durable Execution](https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-durable-execution). <br/> <br/>

## Anatomy of a Function

Every Inngest function consists of three essential parts that work together to create reliable, scalable workflows. This consistent structure makes functions predictable to write, debug, and maintain across your entire application. You define these parts using the [`inngest.createFunction()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create) method from the Inngest SDK.

```typescript
export const processOrder = inngest.createFunction(
  // 1. Configuration
  { 
    id: "process-order",
    concurrency: { limit: 10 },
    retries: 3
  },
  // 2. Trigger
  { event: "order/created" },
  // 3. Handler
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Your business logic here using Inngest Step tools
  }
);
```

### Configuration

The configuration object controls how your function executes in production. It acts as your function's "control panel" for performance, reliability, and identification.

| Setting | Purpose | Example & Link |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **ID** | Required unique identifier | `"process-order"` ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#configuration)) |
| **Name** | Optional display name for dashboard | `"Process Order"` ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#configuration)) |
| **Concurrency** | How many instances can run simultaneously | `{ limit: 5, key: "event.data.userId" }` ([Guide](/concepts/flow-control#concurrency-control)) |
| **Rate Limiting** | How frequently function can execute | `{ limit: 100, period: "1h" }` ([Guide](/concepts/flow-control#rate-limiting)) |
| **Retries** | How many times to retry on failure | `3` ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries)) |
| **Batching** | Process events individually or in groups | `{ maxSize: 50, timeout: "10s" }` ([Guide](/concepts/flow-control#event-batching)) |
| **Error Handling** | What happens when all retries fail | `onFailure: async ({ error }) => {...}` ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures)) |

*For a full list of options, see the [official `createFunction` reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#configuration).*

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  **Pro Tip: `id` vs. `name`**
  - The function `id` is critical for Inngest to track and manage your function; it should be unique and stable. Once deployed, changing an `id` is like creating a new function.
  - The `name` is a human-readable display name for the Inngest dashboard and can be changed more freely without affecting function execution.
</Callout>

### Triggers

Triggers define **when** your function should execute. They're like powerful event listeners that can respond to multiple types of inputs, making your workflows adaptable to different scenarios.

| Trigger Type | Purpose | Example Use Case & Link |
|--------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **[Event](/concepts/events)** | Respond to things happening in your app | User signup, order created ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers)) |
| **Schedule (Cron)** | Run on a time schedule | Daily reports, weekly cleanups ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/scheduled-functions)) |
| **Multiple Events** | Respond to different related events | `user/created` or `user/updated` ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers)) |
| **Pattern Matching** | Respond to event families | All events starting with `user/*` ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers#wildcard-event-triggers)) |

**Key Benefits:**
- One function can have multiple triggers ([Docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers))
- Functions automatically scale based on incoming events
- No infrastructure setup required - just define what should trigger execution

*Explore all trigger options in the [official `createFunction` trigger reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#trigger).*

### Handler Function

The handler contains your business logic and receives powerful tools for building reliable workflows. The parameters passed to your handler provide context about the triggering event and the tools needed for durable execution.

**Function Parameters:**

| Parameter | Purpose | What You Get |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `event` | The data that triggered this function | Event name, payload data, timestamp, unique ID. See [Event Payload Format](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format). |
| `step` | Durable execution tools | `run()`, `sleep()`, `waitForEvent()`, `invoke()` for checkpoints. See [Steps Concept](/concepts/steps). |
| `logger` | Structured logging | Logs that appear in Inngest dashboard with context. See [Logging Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/logging). |
| `runId` | Unique execution identifier | Track this specific function run across systems. |

**Why the `step` object matters:**
- **Checkpoints**: Each `step.run()` saves progress - if step 3 fails, steps 1-2 don't re-execute. [Learn about memoization](/concepts/steps#memoization).
- **Reliability**: Failed steps retry automatically with exponential backoff. See [Error Handling in Steps](/concepts/steps#error-handling-in-steps).
- **Visibility**: Every step appears in the Inngest dashboard for debugging. See [Inspecting Function Runs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs).

*For a complete list of handler arguments, see the [official handler reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#handler).*

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Crucial: The `step` Object for Durability**
  The `step` object is your primary tool for ensuring durable execution. Any I/O operation (API calls, database interactions), code that might fail, or points where you want to ensure resumability **must** be wrapped in a `step` tool (e.g., `step.run()`, `step.sleep()`, `step.waitForEvent()`). This is what allows Inngest to checkpoint progress and reliably retry only the necessary parts of your function.
</Callout>

## Function Types

Functions serve different purposes depending on how and when they execute. Each type solves specific workflow challenges and provides different execution guarantees. Understanding when to use each type helps you build more efficient and reliable systems.

### Background Functions
**Choose this when:** You need to offload work from your API request-response cycle to keep responses fast, for tasks that don't require immediate completion before responding to the user.

Process work outside your API request flow to keep responses fast. These functions handle time-consuming tasks like sending emails, processing images, or syncing data with external APIs.

By moving this work to the background, your users get instant API responses while the heavy lifting happens asynchronously. Perfect for any work that doesn't need to complete before responding to a user request. [See official Background Jobs guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/background-jobs).

```typescript
export const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-welcome-email" },
  { event: "user/signup" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const user = await step.run("fetch-user", () => 
      db.users.findById(event.data.userId)
    );

    await step.run("send-email", () => 
      emailService.send({ to: user.email, template: "welcome" })
    );
  }
);
```

### Scheduled Functions
**Choose this when:** You need to run tasks on a recurring time-based schedule, replacing traditional cron jobs with more robust, observable, and maintainable solutions.

Run tasks on a time-based schedule, similar to cron jobs but with built-in reliability and observability. These functions are ideal for recurring maintenance tasks, generating reports, or cleaning up expired records.

Unlike traditional cron jobs, scheduled functions automatically retry on failure, log their execution, and provide visibility into their performance. [See official Scheduled Functions guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/scheduled-functions).

```typescript
export const generateDailyReport = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "daily-report" },
  { cron: "0 9 * * *" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    const data = await step.run("collect-data", () => 
      analytics.getYesterdayStats()
    );

    await step.run("send-report", () => 
      emailService.send({ to: ["team@company.com"], data })
    );
  }
);
```

### Multi-Step Workflows
**Choose this when:** You have complex processes with multiple dependent operations, requiring high reliability and the ability to resume from failure points, especially if the process spans significant time or involves external systems.

Break complex processes into reliable, resumable [steps](/concepts/steps) that can span minutes, hours, or even days. Each step creates a checkpoint, so if anything fails partway through, the workflow resumes from the last successful step rather than starting over.

This is crucial for processes involving external APIs, payments, approvals, or any multi-stage business logic where partial completion would be problematic. [See official Multi-Step Functions guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multi-step-functions).

```typescript
export const processPayment = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-payment" },
  { event: "payment/requested" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Validate payment
    const validation = await step.run("validate", () => 
      paymentValidator.validate(event.data)
    );

    if (!validation.valid) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid payment: ${validation.errors.join(", ")}`);
    }

    // Process payment
    const payment = await step.run("charge", () => 
      paymentProcessor.charge(event.data)
    );

    // Send confirmation
    await step.run("confirm", () => 
      emailService.send({ 
        to: event.data.userEmail, 
        template: "payment-success",
        data: { transactionId: payment.id }
      })
    );

    return { paymentId: payment.id, status: "completed" };
  }
);
```

## Advanced Configuration

Fine-tune how your functions execute in production to protect your infrastructure and external services. These settings help you manage load, prevent overwhelming APIs, and ensure fair resource allocation. See the [Flow Control concept page](/concepts/flow-control) for a detailed breakdown.

```typescript
{
  // Limit concurrent executions
  concurrency: { limit: 5, key: "event.data.userId" },
  
  // Control execution frequency  
  rateLimit: { limit: 100, period: "1h" },
  
  // Process events in batches
  batchEvents: { maxSize: 50, timeout: "10s" },
  
  // Handle failures
  retries: 3,
  onFailure: async ({ error }) => alerting.send(error.message)
}
```

## Function Composition

Build complex workflows by connecting functions together into larger business processes. Function composition allows you to create modular, reusable workflows where each function has a single responsibility. Read more in the [Invoking Functions Directly guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/invoking-functions-directly).

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔗">
  **`step.invoke()` vs. `step.sendEvent()` for Composition**
  - **`step.invoke(function, ...)`**: Use for a more direct, synchronous-like call. The parent function waits for the invoked (child) function to complete and receive its result. Both functions are part of the same trace, and the invocation itself is a durable step.
  - **`step.sendEvent(eventName, ...)`**: Use for fully decoupled, asynchronous triggering. The parent function sends an event and moves on. A separate function (or functions) listening for that event will be triggered independently. This is true event-driven choreography.
  Choose based on whether you need a direct result and tight coupling or prefer loose coupling and asynchronous processing.
</Callout>

### Calling Other Functions (Synchronous)
Use `step.invoke()` to call other functions and wait for their results. This creates a parent-child relationship where the calling function waits for the invoked function to complete before continuing. [See `step.invoke()` reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-invoke).

```typescript
export const orderWorkflow = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "order-workflow" },
  { event: "order/created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const payment = await step.invoke("process-payment", {
      function: processPaymentFunction, // This is another Inngest function
      data: event.data
    });

    const fulfillment = await step.invoke("fulfill-order", {
      function: fulfillOrderFunction, // Another Inngest function
      data: { orderId: event.data.orderId, paymentId: payment.id }
    });

    return { payment, fulfillment };
  }
);
```

## Testing Functions

Test your functions like any other TypeScript code, with additional tools specifically designed for Inngest workflows. Unit testing focuses on the business logic within each step, using mocks to isolate external dependencies. Integration testing verifies that functions work correctly with real Inngest infrastructure. [Learn more about testing strategies](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/testing).

```typescript
// Unit testing with mocks
import { createStepTools } from "inngest/test"; // From @inngest/test package

const { step } = createStepTools();
step.run.mockResolvedValue({ id: "payment_123" });

const result = await processOrder.handler({ event: mockEvent, step });

// Integration testing with test engine  
import { InngestTestEngine } from "inngest/test";

const t = new InngestTestEngine({ functions: [processOrder] });
await t.send({ name: "order/created", data: { orderId: "123" } });
const runs = await t.waitForRuns("process-order");
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="🎯">
  **Key Testing Strategy: Combine Unit and Integration Tests**
  - **Unit Tests**: Use `createStepTools()` from `inngest/test` to mock step behaviors (`step.run`, `step.sleep`, etc.) and test the internal logic of your function handler in isolation. This is fast and good for verifying conditional logic within your function.
  - **Integration Tests**: Use `InngestTestEngine` from `inngest/test` to perform end-to-end testing of your functions. Send actual events, let Inngest execute your function (including all its steps), and verify the final outcome, any events sent, or side effects. This gives higher confidence in the overall workflow.
  Both are crucial for robust, production-ready functions.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Step Names**: Clear step names (e.g., `"charge-stripe-customer"`) are crucial for observability in logs and the Inngest dashboard. Ensure they are unique within a function. ([More on Naming Steps](/concepts/steps#step-best-practices)).
2. **Keep Steps Atomic**: Design each `step.run()` to perform one logical, retryable unit of work. This improves error isolation and workflow clarity. ([More on Atomicity](/concepts/steps#2-keep-steps-atomic)).
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement `try/catch` blocks within steps for specific business logic errors, and use `NonRetriableError` for failures that shouldn't be retried. Leverage function-level `onFailure` handlers for terminal error states. ([Error Handling Patterns](/quick-start/patterns#error-handling-in-steps)).
4. **Leverage Type Safety**: Define and use types for your event payloads and function inputs/outputs. This greatly improves the development experience and helps prevent runtime errors. ([TypeScript with Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/docs/typescript)).
5. **Monitor Function Performance**: Regularly use the [Inngest dashboard](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor) to track execution times, success/failure rates, and log output to identify issues or areas for optimization.
6. **Idempotent Design for External Interactions**: When steps interact with external systems, ensure those interactions are idempotent or handled in a way that retries don't cause duplicate operations (e.g., using idempotency keys if supported by the external API).
