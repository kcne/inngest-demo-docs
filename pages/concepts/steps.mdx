# Steps

Steps are Inngest's solution to the fundamental problem of building reliable distributed systems: **what happens when things fail?** Steps are the core of Inngest's [Durable Execution](https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-durable-execution) engine.

In traditional systems, failed jobs restart from the beginning, losing all progress and potentially causing duplicate work. Steps create **[checkpoints](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#how-steps-work)** in your [Functions](/concepts/functions) so only failed operations retry - successful work is preserved forever, making workflows [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science). <br/> <br/>

## The Reliability Problem

Imagine an order processing workflow with five operations. Without steps, a failure at step 4 means starting over, which can lead to issues like duplicate charges or re-sending notifications.

```typescript
// ❌ Traditional approach - fragile
export async function processOrder(orderId) {
  const order = await fetchOrder(orderId);        // Step 1
  const payment = await chargePayment(order);     // Step 2  
  const inventory = await updateInventory(order); // Step 3
  const shipment = await createShipment(order);   // Step 4 - If this fails, ALL steps re-run!
  await sendNotification(order, shipment);      // Step 5
}
```

## How Steps Work

Steps transform your functions into durable, resumable workflows that can survive any failure. When you use steps, Inngest creates checkpoints at each operation, storing both the inputs and outputs permanently. This checkpoint system means your functions can pause, restart, and resume from exactly where they left off, even across server restarts, deployments, or infrastructure failures. [Learn about Inngest's execution model](https://www.inngest.com/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed).

```typescript
// ✅ Inngest approach - resilient
import { inngest } from "../client"; // Your Inngest client

export const processOrderWithSteps = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-order-with-steps" },
  { event: "order/created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const order = await step.run("fetch-order", () => 
      fetchOrder(event.data.orderId)
    );

    const payment = await step.run("charge-payment", () => 
      chargePayment(order)
    );

    const inventory = await step.run("update-inventory", () => 
      updateInventory(order)
    );

    // If createShipment fails, only this step.run() retries.
    // fetch-order, charge-payment, and update-inventory are NOT re-executed.
    const shipment = await step.run("create-shipment", () => 
      createShipment(order)
    );

    await step.run("send-notification", () => 
      sendNotification(order, shipment)
    );

    return { orderId: order.id, shipmentId: shipment.id };
  }
);
```

### Step Execution Model
Each step executes in isolation and communicates with Inngest's execution engine. When a step completes successfully, its result is stored permanently and will never re-execute, even if the function is retried. If a step fails, only that specific step retries while all previous successful steps return their [memoized](/concepts/steps#memoization) results.

### Memoization
Successful step outputs are saved (memoized) and reused if the function retries. This prevents duplicate work and ensures steps are [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science). For example, if `chargePayment()` succeeds and `updateInventory()` fails, `chargePayment()` won't run again on retry – Inngest uses its saved result. [Read more on Memoization in Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#memoization).

  **Key Benefit: Idempotency and Efficiency via Memoization**
  The automatic memoization of successful step results is a cornerstone of Inngest's reliability. It means:
  - **No Duplicate Work**: Operations that have already completed successfully (e.g., sending an email, charging a card) will *not* re-run if a later step fails.
  - **True Idempotency**: Your functions behave idempotently at the step level, simplifying logic and preventing unintended side effects during retries.
  - **Efficiency**: Saves execution time and resources by not re-processing what has already been done.

## Step Tools

The `step` object provides various tools for orchestrating complex workflows:

| Tool | Purpose & Key Features | Official Docs |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| **`step.run()`** | Execute a unit of work, retry on failure, memoize result. The most common step tool. | [step.run()](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-run) |
| **`step.sleep()`** | Pause execution for a duration (e.g., "5m", "1d"). Useful for scheduled follow-ups or delays. | [step.sleep()](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep) |
| **`step.waitForEvent()`** | Pause until a specific event arrives. Ideal for approvals or external signals. | [step.waitForEvent()](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event) |
| **`step.invoke()`** | Call another Inngest function and wait for its result. For composing workflows. | [step.invoke()](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-invoke) |
| **`step.sendEvent()`** | Send one or more events. For triggering other functions or continuing a workflow. | [step.sendEvent()](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-send-event) |
| **`step.parallel()`** | Run multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and wait for all to complete. | [step.parallel()](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-parallel) |

## Advanced Step Patterns

Beyond simple sequential execution, steps enable sophisticated workflow patterns that handle real-world complexity. These patterns are essential for building robust, production-grade applications.

### `step.sleep` - Scheduled Delays
Pause a workflow for a specific duration, from seconds to days, using [`step.sleep()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep). The state of the workflow is preserved during the sleep.

**Ideal for**: Creating drip email campaigns, reminder systems, scheduled follow-ups, or any process that needs to wait for a period before continuing. [See sleep use cases](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/scheduled-functions#sleeps-for-dynamic-schedules).

```typescript
// Example: Follow up after 7 days if user hasn't activated
await step.sleep("wait-for-activation-check", "7d");
const user = await step.run("refetch-user", () => db.users.findById(event.data.userId));
if (!user.activated) {
  await step.run("send-reminder", () => email.sendActivationReminder(user));
}
```

### `step.waitForEvent` - Wait for External Input
Pause a workflow until a specific external event occurs using [`step.waitForEvent()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event). The function remains dormant until the target event is received (or a timeout is hit), then resumes with the event's data.

**Ideal for**: Approval steps, waiting for user actions (e.g., email verification click), or integrating with asynchronous third-party systems that use webhooks

```typescript
// Example: Expense report approval
await step.run("submit-for-approval", () => expenseApi.submit(reportData));
const approvalEvent = await step.waitForEvent("wait-for-approval", {
  event: "expense/approved_or_denied",
  timeout: "5d", // Wait up to 5 days
  if: `event.data.reportId == "${reportData.id}"` // Match specific report
});

if (approvalEvent?.data.status === "approved") {
  await step.run("process-reimbursement", () => paymentApi.reimburse(reportData));
}
```

  **Pro Tip: Orchestrate Complex Interactions**
  Tools like `step.waitForEvent()` and `step.invoke()` (discussed next) are powerful for building sophisticated workflows. You can orchestrate human-in-the-loop processes (e.g., manager approvals), coordinate with external systems via webhooks, or compose multiple Inngest functions into larger, cohesive business processes—all while maintaining the durability and observability Inngest provides.
</Callout>

### `step.invoke` - Composable Workflows
Break down large workflows into smaller, reusable Inngest functions using [`step.invoke()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-invoke). This calls another Inngest function and waits for its result, similar to a synchronous function call but with full durability and observability for the invoked function.

**Ideal for**: Promoting modularity, testability, and reusability of workflow logic; building complex parent-child function relationships. [See function composition guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/invoking-functions-directly).

```typescript
// Parent workflow
const paymentResult = await step.invoke("process-payment-subflow", {
  function: processPaymentFunction, // Another Inngest function
  data: { amount: order.total, userId: order.userId }
});

if (paymentResult.status === "failed") {
  // Handle payment failure
}
```

### `step.parallel` - Concurrent Operations
Execute multiple asynchronous operations at the same time using [`step.parallel()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-parallel) and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding. Each parallel operation is still a durable step.

**Ideal for**: Speeding up execution by running independent tasks concurrently, such as fetching data from multiple external APIs, processing items in a collection independently, or performing parallel writes.

```typescript
// Example: Enrich user data from multiple APIs
const [profile, activity, settings] = await step.parallel([
  () => step.run("fetch-profile", () => userApi.getProfile(userId)),
  () => step.run("fetch-activity", () => activityApi.getActivity(userId)),
  () => step.run("fetch-settings", () => settingsApi.getSettings(userId))
]);

const enrichedUser = { ...profile, ...activity, ...settings };
```

## Error Handling in Steps

Steps have built-in [automatic retries with exponential backoff](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries). You can also implement custom error handling within your step functions using standard `try/catch` blocks for business logic errors, or use Inngest's [`onFailure` handler](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures) for function-level error management. For detailed strategies, see our [Error Handling guide](/quick-start/patterns#error-handling-in-steps) and the [official Error Handling docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/error-handling).

## Step Best Practices

1.  **Use descriptive step names**: Good names (e.g., `"charge-stripe-customer"`) improve [observability](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor) in the Inngest dashboard. They should be unique within a function. [More on Naming Steps](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#naming-steps).
2.  **Keep steps atomic**: Each `step.run()` should ideally perform one logical unit of work. This makes retries safer and workflows easier to understand.
3.  **Pass data explicitly**: Steps are memoized based on their name and inputs. If a step needs data from a previous step, pass it explicitly. Relying on shared mutable state outside of step inputs/outputs can lead to unexpected behavior during retries. See [data passing recommendations](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#passing-data-between-steps).
