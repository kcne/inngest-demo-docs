# Events

Events are the core building blocks of Inngest's [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture). They represent immutable records of things that happen in your system - user signups, order completions, file uploads, or any significant state change. Think of events as **announcements**: "Hey, something important just happened!". Your [Functions](/concepts/functions) listen for these announcements and automatically spring into action. <br/> <br/>

## Why Events Matter

Events solve a fundamental problem in application architecture: **tight coupling between your core application and background processing**. Without events, your API routes become bloated with background work, making them slow and brittle. Events decouple these concerns, allowing your application to respond instantly while background work happens reliably in parallel using Inngest's [durable execution](/concepts/steps) model.

### Without Events (Traditional Queue System)
```typescript
// Complex setup: multiple queues, worker processes, manual error handling
const Queue = require('bull');
const emailQueue = new Queue('email', process.env.REDIS_URL);
const analyticsQueue = new Queue('analytics', process.env.REDIS_URL);

app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.create(req.body);
  await emailQueue.add('welcome', { email: user.email });
  await analyticsQueue.add('track', { userId: user.id, event: 'user_created' });
  res.json(user);
});

// Separate worker for emails
emailQueue.process('welcome', async (job) => emailService.sendWelcome(job.data.email));
// Separate worker for analytics with its own error/retry logic
analyticsQueue.process('track', async (job) => analyticsService.track(job.data.event, job.data.userId));
```

### With Events (Inngest)
```typescript
// API route: simple event sending
app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.create(req.body);
  await inngest.send({
    name: "user/created",
    data: { userId: user.id, email: user.email }
  });
  res.json(user);
});

// Functions automatically handle events with built-in reliability
export const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-welcome" }, { event: "user/created" }, // Trigger
  async ({ event }) => await emailService.sendWelcome(event.data.email)
);
export const trackUser = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "track-user" }, { event: "user/created" }, // Trigger
  async ({ event }) => await analyticsService.track('user_created', event.data.userId)
);
```
**The result**: Your API is fast, background work is reliable via [Inngest Functions](/concepts/functions), and adding new workflows (e.g., a new function listening to `user/created`) doesn't require changing existing API code.

  **Key Takeaways: Why Events Unlock Better Systems**
  - **Faster API Responses**: Offload work from the main request path.
  - **Decoupled Services**: Core application logic remains clean and independent of background task execution.
  - **Extensibility**: Easily add new listeners (Functions) for existing events without modifying producer code.
  - **Improved Reliability**: Background tasks benefit from Inngest's built-in durability and retries.

## Event Structure

Every Inngest event follows a simple, consistent JSON structure, crucial for predictability in your functions and easy inspection in the [Inngest dashboard](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor). This structure comprises a `name` and an optional `data` payload. [See official Event Format docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format).

```typescript
{
  "name": "user/signup",     // Required: String identifier for the event type
  "data": {                 // Optional: JSON-serializable payload with event-specific info
    "userId": "usr_123",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "plan": "premium"
  }
  // Optional fields like `id`, `ts`, `v` are auto-added by Inngest
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="✍️">
  **Best Practices for Event Design**
  - **Naming**: Use clear, hierarchical names (e.g., `noun/verb_past_tense`, like `user/signed_up`, `order/payment_succeeded`). Refer to [Event Naming Tips](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format#tips-for-event-naming).
  - **Payloads**: Include essential identifiers (`userId`, `orderId`) and just enough data for functions to act without excessive lookups. 
  - **Data Size & Sensitivity**: Avoid embedding large data blobs (send references like IDs or URLs instead) or highly sensitive information. See detailed [Event Payload Best Practices](#event-payload-best-practices) later in this document.
</Callout>

**Key Components:**
-   **`name` (string, required)**: A unique identifier for the event type. Use clear, hierarchical names (e.g., `user/signup`, `order/payment_succeeded`). [See Naming Tips](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format#tips-for-event-naming).
-   **`data` (object, optional)**: A JSON-serializable payload containing details relevant to the event. Design this carefully as events are immutable once sent.

## Sending Events

Events can be sent from anywhere in your application—API routes, database triggers ([CDC patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)), webhooks, or other background jobs. This flexibility decouples event creation from processing. The Inngest SDK (`inngest.send()`) is the primary method. [See Sending Events guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events).

**Common Sources & Examples:**
```typescript
// From API routes (e.g., Next.js, Express)
await inngest.send({
  name: "order/created",
  data: { orderId: order.id, userId: order.userId, total: order.amount }
});

// From webhook handlers (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
await inngest.send({
  name: `stripe/invoice.payment_succeeded`, // Dynamic event name
  data: stripeEvent.data.object // Forwarding webhook payload
});

// Batch sending for efficiency (reduces network calls)
await inngest.send([
  { name: "user/profile_updated", data: { userId: "123", changes: ["email"] } },
  { name: "user/activity_logged", data: { userId: "123", activity: "logged_in" } }
]); // See: https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/typescript/sdk#send
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚡️">
  **Performance Tip: Batch Event Sending**
  When sending multiple events, especially in bulk operations (e.g., after a batch import), always prefer `inngest.send([...events])`. This sends all events in a single network request, significantly reducing overhead and improving efficiency compared to sending them one by one.
</Callout>

## Common Event Patterns

Leverage these patterns to build scalable and maintainable event-driven systems.

### Fan-Out
One event triggers multiple independent functions. This is ideal for decoupling processes. For example, a single `user/signup` event might concurrently trigger separate functions for sending a welcome email, updating analytics, and provisioning trial resources.

**Example: `user/signup` event triggers:**
*   `sendWelcomeEmailFn` (handles sending a welcome email)
*   `setupNewUserAnalyticsFn` (tracks new user in analytics)
*   `createTrialResourcesFn` (provisions initial resources for a new user)

Each function operates independently, managing its own logic and retries. [See Fan-out Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/fan-out-jobs).

### Event Chains
A function, after completing its work, sends a new event that then triggers a subsequent function. This creates a sequence of decoupled operations. For instance, an `order/created` event might trigger a `ProcessPaymentFunction`. Upon successful payment, this function sends an `order/payment_succeeded` event, which in turn triggers an `FulfillOrderFunction`.

This pattern differs from `step.invoke()` (which is a direct, synchronous-like call between functions within the same trace) by maintaining complete decoupling between the functions; they only communicate via the event bus.

```typescript
// In ProcessPaymentFunction, after successful payment:
await step.run("trigger-fulfillment", () =>
  inngest.send({ name: "order/paid", data: event.data }) // `event.data` from `order/created`
);
// FulfillOrderFunction would be triggered by "order/paid"
```

## Event Matching and Filtering

Functions can subscribe to events with fine-grained control using matching and filtering rules defined in the [function trigger](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#trigger). This is crucial for routing events to the correct workflows. Here's a quick overview:

| Matching Type             | Description                                                                 | Example Trigger Configuration                      |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wildcard Suffix**       | Match all events starting with a certain prefix.                            | `{ event: "user/*" }`                              |
| **Wildcard (Alternatives)** | Match specific events from a list within a namespace.                     | `{ event: "order/{created,updated,cancelled}" }` |
| **Multiple Event Names**  | Subscribe to a specific list of distinct event names.                     | `{ event: ["user/login", "user/profile_view"] }` |
| **Conditional (`if`)**    | Filter events based on a JSONata expression against the event data payload. | `{ event: "order/created", if: "event.data.total > 1000" }` |

### Pattern Matching
Use wildcards in event names for broader subscriptions.
-   `user/*`: Matches `user/created`, `user/updated`, `user/deleted`.

```typescript
// Listens to all events starting with "user/"
export const userActivityLogger = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "user-activity-logger" },
  { event: "user/*" }, // Wildcard match
  async ({ event }) => { /* Log event.name and event.data */ }
);
```
[See Wildcard Event Triggers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers#wildcard-event-triggers).

### Multiple Event Types
A single function can listen to an array of distinct event names.

```typescript
export const userLifecycleManager = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "user-lifecycle" },
  // Responds to either of these events
  { event: ["user/trial_started", "user/subscription_cancelled"] },
  async ({ event }) => { /* Handle based on event.name */ }
);
```
[See Multiple Event Triggers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers).

### Conditional Filtering (`if` expression)
Filter events based on their `data` payload using a JSONata expression. The function only triggers if the expression evaluates to true.

```typescript
export const largeOrderAlert = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "large-order-alert" },
  { 
    event: "order/created",
    // Only trigger if order total is greater than $1000
    if: "event.data.total > 1000" 
  },
  async ({ event }) => { /* Alert operations team */ }
);
```
[See Conditional Event Triggers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/conditional-triggers).

## Debugging Events

The [Inngest Dev Server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/dev-server) (`npx inngest-cli dev`) is invaluable for local development. It provides a UI (typically `http://localhost:8288`) to inspect events, see which functions they trigger, and view logs. This helps verify event flow and troubleshoot function behavior.

**Key Debugging Capabilities:**
-   **Live Event Stream**: View events as they are sent.
-   **Function Invocation Details**: See which function runs were triggered by which events.
-   **Payload Inspection**: Examine the `data` of any event.
-   **Step-by-Step Execution**: For functions using [steps](/concepts/steps), see the outcome of each step.

## Production Tips

Consider these aspects for robust, scalable event-driven systems.

### Event Payload Best Practices

Well-designed payloads are key to maintainable functions.

**What to Include:**
-   **Essential Identifiers**: Relevant IDs (`userId`, `orderId`).
-   **Sufficient Context**: Data needed by listeners to act without many extra lookups.
-   **Timestamps**: When the original action occurred.
-   **Source/Correlation IDs**: For tracing and debugging across systems.

**What to Avoid:**
-   **Overly Large Payloads**: Inngest events have a size limit (e.g., 256KB, check current [limitations](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/limitations)). For large data (files, images), send a reference (e.g., S3 URL, database ID) instead of the data itself.
-   **Sensitive Information**: PII like passwords, raw credit card numbers. Tokenize or encrypt if necessary, or better yet, design workflows to avoid needing it in event data.
-   **Internal Implementation Details**: Avoid exposing database schemas or internal state that might change and break downstream consumers.

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
  **Security Warning: Protect Sensitive Data**
  Never include highly sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as passwords, raw credit card numbers, or government-issued identification numbers directly in event payloads. If such data is indirectly needed for a workflow, pass secure references or tokens instead, and retrieve the sensitive data within a secure step in your function. Always prioritize data minimization in events.
</Callout>

[See official guidance on Event Payloads](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format).

### Error Handling for Events

Address failures in both sending and processing events.

**Sending Failures:**

When sending critical events, it's important to handle potential failures in the `inngest.send()` call (e.g., due to network issues or Inngest API errors). Consider these strategies:
*   Implement application-level retries around your `inngest.send()` call for transient issues.
*   For highly critical events where guaranteed delivery to Inngest is paramount, consider a dead-lettering mechanism or a local fallback queue if the initial send fails repeatedly.

```typescript
try {
  await inngest.send(criticalEvent);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error("Failed to send critical event to Inngest", { error });
  // Implement retry or add to a local fallback queue
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧪">
  **Testing Tip: Leverage `InngestTestEngine`**
  For robust integration testing of your event-driven workflows, the `InngestTestEngine` (from `@inngest/test`) is invaluable. It allows you to send test events, run your functions locally within the engine, and assert step completion, function outcomes, and any events sent by your functions. This provides much higher confidence than unit testing alone.
</Callout>

**Integration Testing Functions**: Use the [`InngestTestEngine`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/testing#inngesttestengine) from `@inngest/test` to send events and assert function execution, step completion, and outcomes. This is the most effective way to test workflows.

```typescript
// workflow.test.ts
import { InngestTestEngine } from "inngest/test";
import { myInngestFunction } from "./functions";

const engine = new InngestTestEngine({ functions: [myInngestFunction] });
await engine.send({ name: "trigger/event", data: { ... } });
const runs = await engine.waitForRuns("myInngestFunction");
expect(runs[0].status).toBe("completed");
```
[See official Testing Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/testing).

### Performance Considerations

Optimize event handling for scalability with these key practices:

*   **Batch Event Sending**: Use `inngest.send([...events])` to send multiple events in one API call, significantly reducing network overhead. This is highly recommended for any bulk operations.
*   **Async Sending (for non-critical events)**: For events not critical to the immediate response path (e.g., some analytics), consider sending them asynchronously from your main request path (`setImmediate` or a lightweight local queue) to avoid impacting API latency.
*   **Payload Size Optimization**: Keep event payloads lean. Smaller payloads are processed faster and reduce network transfer times. Follow [best practices](/concepts/events#event-payload-best-practices) for payload design.
