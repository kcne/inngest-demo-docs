# Events

Events are the heartbeat of Inngest's [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture). They represent immutable records of things that happen in your system - user signups, order completions, file uploads, or any significant state change. Think of events as **announcements**: "Hey, something important just happened!" Your [Functions](/concepts/functions) listen for these announcements and automatically spring into action. <br/> <br/>

## Why Events Matter

Events solve a fundamental problem in application architecture: **tight coupling between your core application and background processing**. Without events, your API routes become bloated with background work, making them slow and brittle. Events decouple these concerns, allowing your application to respond instantly while background work happens reliably in parallel using Inngest's [durable execution](/concepts/steps) model.

### Without Events (Traditional Queue System)
```typescript
// Complex setup: multiple queues, worker processes, manual error handling
const Queue = require('bull'); // Example: BullMQ
const emailQueue = new Queue('email', process.env.REDIS_URL);
const analyticsQueue = new Queue('analytics', process.env.REDIS_URL);

app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.create(req.body);
  await emailQueue.add('welcome', { email: user.email });
  await analyticsQueue.add('track', { userId: user.id, event: 'user_created' });
  res.json(user); // API response is quick, but setup is complex
});

// Separate worker for emails
emailQueue.process('welcome', async (job) => emailService.sendWelcome(job.data.email));
// Separate worker for analytics with its own error/retry logic
analyticsQueue.process('track', async (job) => analyticsService.track(job.data.event, job.data.userId));
```

### With Events (Inngest)
```typescript
// API route: simple event sending
app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.create(req.body);
  await inngest.send({ // See: https://www.inngest.com/docs/events
    name: "user/created",
    data: { userId: user.id, email: user.email }
  });
  res.json(user); // API response is fast
});

// Functions automatically handle events with built-in reliability
export const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-welcome" }, { event: "user/created" }, // Trigger
  async ({ event }) => await emailService.sendWelcome(event.data.email)
);
export const trackUser = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "track-user" }, { event: "user/created" }, // Trigger
  async ({ event }) => await analyticsService.track('user_created', event.data.userId)
);
```
**The result**: Your API is fast, background work is reliable via [Inngest Functions](/concepts/functions), and adding new workflows (e.g., a new function listening to `user/created`) doesn't require changing existing API code.

## Event Structure

Every Inngest event follows a simple, consistent JSON structure, crucial for predictability in your functions and easy inspection in the [Inngest dashboard](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor). This structure comprises a `name` and an optional `data` payload. [See official Event Format docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format).

```typescript
{
  "name": "user/signup",     // Required: String identifier for the event type
  "data": {                 // Optional: JSON-serializable payload with event-specific info
    "userId": "usr_123",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "plan": "premium"
  }
  // Optional fields like `id`, `ts`, `v` are auto-added by Inngest
}
```
**Key Components:**
-   **`name` (string, required)**: A unique identifier for the event type. Use clear, hierarchical names (e.g., `user/signup`, `order/payment_succeeded`). [See Naming Tips](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format#tips-for-event-naming).
-   **`data` (object, optional)**: A JSON-serializable payload containing details relevant to the event. Design this carefully as events are immutable once sent.

## Sending Events

Events can be sent from anywhere in your applicationâ€”API routes, database triggers ([CDC patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)), webhooks, or other background jobs. This flexibility decouples event creation from processing. The Inngest SDK (`inngest.send()`) is the primary method. [See Sending Events guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events).

**Common Sources & Examples:**
```typescript
// From API routes (e.g., Next.js, Express)
await inngest.send({
  name: "order/created",
  data: { orderId: order.id, userId: order.userId, total: order.amount }
});

// From webhook handlers (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
await inngest.send({
  name: `stripe/invoice.payment_succeeded`, // Dynamic event name
  data: stripeEvent.data.object // Forwarding webhook payload
});

// Batch sending for efficiency (reduces network calls)
await inngest.send([
  { name: "user/profile_updated", data: { userId: "123", changes: ["email"] } },
  { name: "user/activity_logged", data: { userId: "123", activity: "logged_in" } }
]); // See: https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/typescript/sdk#send
```

## Common Event Patterns

Leverage these patterns to build scalable and maintainable event-driven systems.

### Fan-Out
One event triggers multiple independent functions. This is ideal for decoupling processes; e.g., a `user/signup` event might trigger `SendWelcomeEmail`, `UpdateAnalytics`, and `ProvisionTrialWorkspace` functions, each handling a separate concern. [See Fan-out Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/fan-out-jobs).

```typescript
// Event: user/signed_up
// Functions listening:
// 1. sendWelcomeEmailFn - Handles sending a welcome email.
// 2. setupNewUserAnalyticsFn - Tracks new user in analytics.
// 3. createTrialResourcesFn - Provisions initial resources for a new user.
```

### Event Chains
A function, after completing its work, sends a new event that triggers another function. This creates a sequence of operations. For example, `order/created` -> `ProcessPaymentFunction` -> (sends `order/payment_succeeded`) -> `FulfillOrderFunction`. This differs from [`step.invoke()`](/concepts/functions#function-composition) as it's fully decoupled.

```typescript
// In ProcessPaymentFunction, after successful payment:
await step.run("trigger-fulfillment", () =>
  inngest.send({ name: "order/paid", data: event.data }) // `event.data` from `order/created`
);
// FulfillOrderFunction would be triggered by "order/paid"
```

## Event Matching and Filtering

Functions can subscribe to events with fine-grained control using matching and filtering rules defined in the [function trigger](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#trigger). This is crucial for routing events to the correct workflows.

### Pattern Matching
Use wildcards in event names for broader subscriptions.
-   `user/*`: Matches `user/created`, `user/updated`, `user/deleted`.
-   `order/{created,updated,cancelled}`: Matches specific order lifecycle events.

```typescript
// Listens to all events starting with "user/"
export const userActivityLogger = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "user-activity-logger" },
  { event: "user/*" }, // Wildcard match
  async ({ event }) => { /* Log event.name and event.data */ }
);
```
[See Wildcard Event Triggers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers#wildcard-event-triggers).

### Multiple Event Types
A single function can listen to an array of distinct event names.

```typescript
export const userLifecycleManager = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "user-lifecycle" },
  // Responds to either of these events
  { event: ["user/trial_started", "user/subscription_cancelled"] },
  async ({ event }) => { /* Handle based on event.name */ }
);
```
[See Multiple Event Triggers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multiple-triggers).

### Conditional Filtering (`if` expression)
Filter events based on their `data` payload using a JSONata expression. The function only triggers if the expression evaluates to true.

```typescript
export const largeOrderAlert = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "large-order-alert" },
  { 
    event: "order/created",
    // Only trigger if order total is greater than $1000
    if: "event.data.total > 1000" 
  },
  async ({ event }) => { /* Alert operations team */ }
);
```
[See Conditional Event Triggers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/conditional-triggers).

## Debugging Events

The [Inngest Dev Server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/dev-server) (`npx inngest-cli dev`) is invaluable for local development. It provides a UI (typically `http://localhost:8288`) to inspect events, see which functions they trigger, and view logs. This helps verify event flow and troubleshoot function behavior.

**Key Debugging Capabilities:**
-   **Live Event Stream**: View events as they are sent.
-   **Function Invocation Details**: See which function runs were triggered by which events.
-   **Payload Inspection**: Examine the `data` of any event.
-   **Step-by-Step Execution**: For functions using [steps](/concepts/steps), see the outcome of each step.

## Productionizing Events: Advanced Topics

Consider these aspects for robust, scalable event-driven systems.

### Event Payload Best Practices

Well-designed payloads are key to maintainable functions.

**What to Include:**
-   **Essential Identifiers**: Relevant IDs (`userId`, `orderId`).
-   **Sufficient Context**: Data needed by listeners to act without many extra lookups.
-   **Timestamps**: When the original action occurred.
-   **Source/Correlation IDs**: For tracing and debugging across systems.

**What to Avoid:**
-   **Overly Large Payloads**: Inngest events have a size limit (e.g., 256KB, check current [limitations](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/limitations)). For large data (files, images), send a reference (e.g., S3 URL, database ID) instead of the data itself.
-   **Sensitive Information**: PII like passwords, raw credit card numbers. Tokenize or encrypt if necessary, or better yet, design workflows to avoid needing it in event data.
-   **Internal Implementation Details**: Avoid exposing database schemas or internal state that might change and break downstream consumers.

[See official guidance on Event Payloads](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format).

### Error Handling for Events

Address failures in both sending and processing events.

**Sending Failures:**
The `inngest.send()` call can fail (network issues, Inngest API errors). Implement application-level retries or dead-lettering for critical events if immediate sending is crucial.
```typescript
try {
  await inngest.send(criticalEvent);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error("Failed to send critical event to Inngest", { error });
  // Implement retry or add to a local fallback queue
}
```

**Function Processing Failures:**
[Inngest functions](/concepts/functions) have built-in [retries](/concepts/functions#configuration). For non-retryable business errors, throw `NonRetriableError` from Inngest SDK. Use `onFailure` handlers for terminal failures.
[See Error Handling Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/error-handling).

### Testing Event-Driven Workflows

Thorough testing is vital.

**Unit Testing Senders**: Mock `inngest.send()` to verify your application code emits correct events.
```typescript
// Using Jest
jest.mock('./inngestClient', () => ({
  inngest: { send: jest.fn() }
}));
// ... test your service ...
expect(inngest.send).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedEventMatcher);
```

**Integration Testing Functions**: Use the [`InngestTestEngine`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/testing#inngesttestengine) from `@inngest/test` to send events and assert function execution, step completion, and outcomes. This is the most effective way to test workflows.

```typescript
// workflow.test.ts
import { InngestTestEngine } from "inngest/test";
import { myInngestFunction } from "./functions";

const engine = new InngestTestEngine({ functions: [myInngestFunction] });
await engine.send({ name: "trigger/event", data: { ... } });
const runs = await engine.waitForRuns("myInngestFunction");
expect(runs[0].status).toBe("completed");
```
[See official Testing Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/testing).

### Performance Considerations

Optimize event handling for scalability.

**Batch Event Sending**: Use `inngest.send([...events])` to send multiple events in one API call, reducing network overhead. This is highly recommended for bulk operations.

**Async Sending**: For non-critical events (e.g., analytics), consider sending them asynchronously from your main request path (`setImmediate` or a lightweight local queue) to avoid impacting API latency.

**Payload Size**: Smaller payloads are processed faster. Follow [best practices](/concepts/events#event-payload-best-practices) to keep them lean.
