# Core Concepts

Understanding Inngest's core concepts is the key to building reliable, scalable workflows. Each concept builds on the others to create a powerful system that eliminates the complexity of traditional [background job processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_queue) and [message queue systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue). <br/> <br/>

## Building Blocks

Inngest's power comes from the synergy of four fundamental concepts, enabling you to build complex, reliable systems with simple, declarative code. This approach aligns with modern [event-driven architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/eda.html) principles and provides a robust foundation for [durable execution](https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-durable-execution).

1.  **[Events](/concepts/events)**: The foundation of Inngest. Events are immutable facts about something that happened in your system (e.g., `user.signup`, `order.created`). They act as triggers, decoupling your application's core logic from the background work that needs to be done. Learn more about [sending events](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events) and the [event payload format](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/events-triggers/event-format).

2.  **[Functions](/concepts/functions)**: These are your workhorses. Functions listen for specific [events](/concepts/events) and execute your business logic in response. They can be simple background tasks or complex, multi-step workflows. Inngest functions provide built-in [retry mechanisms](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries) and state management. See the [Functions Overview](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions).

3.  **[Steps](/concepts/steps)**: Steps are the secret sauce for reliability. Within a function, each `step.run()` (and other step tools like `step.sleep()` or `step.waitForEvent()`) creates a durable checkpoint. If a function fails, it resumes from the last successful step, preventing data loss or duplicate operations. This makes your workflows [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science) and fault-tolerant. [Learn how steps work](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#how-steps-work) and explore [different step tools](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows).

4.  **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)**: Manage how your functions execute at scale. Inngest provides powerful tools like [concurrency limits](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/concurrency), [rate limiting](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/rate-limiting), [event batching](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/batching), and [debouncing](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/debounce) to protect your infrastructure and third-party APIs, ensuring smooth operation even under heavy load. Dive into [Flow Control features](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control).

| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Events](/concepts/events)**        | The triggers that start everything              | Decouple your app from background jobs             |
| **[Functions](/concepts/functions)**  | Where your business logic lives                 | Orchestrate workflows and respond to events        |
| **[Steps](/concepts/steps)**          | Checkpoints that make functions durable         | Avoid re-work when failures happen                 |
| **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)** | Controls how functions execute at scale         | Protect your infrastructure and APIs               |

## How They Work Together

This example illustrates the interplay of all core Inngest concepts to process an e-commerce order. As you review the code, notice the following:

*   **Event Dispatch**: An `order/created` event is sent using `inngest.send()`, initiating the workflow.
*   **Function Definition**: The `processOrder` function is created with `inngest.createFunction()`, specifying its unique `id`, a display `name`, and the `event` it listens to.
*   **Durable Steps**: Each critical operation (payment, inventory update, email sending) is wrapped in a `step.run()`. This makes each operation a durable checkpoint that Inngest can retry independently.
*   **Flow Control**: The function includes `concurrency` and `rateLimit` configurations to manage how many instances run and how often, protecting downstream services.
*   **Logging**: `logger.info()` is used to provide contextual information about the function's execution, visible in the Inngest dashboard.

```typescript
// EVENT: An "order/created" event is sent when a customer places an order.
await inngest.send({
  name: "order/created",
  data: { orderId: "123", userId: "456", total: 99.99 }
});

// FUNCTION: This Inngest function is triggered by the "order/created" event.
export const processOrder = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "process-order",
    name: "Process Customer Order",
    // FLOW CONTROL: Ensure system stability under load.
    // Limit to 5 concurrent executions of this function for the same customer.
    concurrency: { limit: 5, key: "event.data.userId" },
    // Allow up to 1000 order processing events per hour globally for this function.
    rateLimit: { limit: 1000, period: "1h" }
  },
  { event: "order/created" }, // Trigger for the function
  async ({ event, step, logger }) => {
    logger.info("Starting order processing", { orderId: event.data.orderId });

    // STEPS: Each step is a durable, retryable unit of work.
    // Step 1: Process payment via Stripe.
    const payment = await step.run("process-payment", async () => {
      return stripe.charges.create({
        amount: event.data.total,
        currency: "usd",
        source: event.data.paymentToken,
        description: `Order ${event.data.orderId}`
      });
    });

    logger.info("Payment processed", { paymentId: payment.id });

    // Step 2: Update inventory.
    const inventoryUpdate = await step.run("update-inventory", async () => {
      return inventoryService.decrementStock(event.data.items);
    });

    logger.info("Inventory updated", { items: inventoryUpdate.updatedItems });

    // Step 3: Send confirmation email.
    await step.run("send-confirmation-email", async () => {
      return emailService.sendOrderConfirmation(
        event.data.userId,
        { orderId: event.data.orderId, paymentId: payment.id, items: event.data.items }
      );
    });
    
    logger.info("Confirmation email sent");

    return { success: true, orderId: event.data.orderId, paymentId: payment.id };
  }
);
```

**In this workflow:**
- An **[Event](/concepts/events)**(`order/created`) initiates the process. [Events reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events/event-format).
- The **[Function](/concepts/functions)**(`processOrder`) orchestrates the entire order fulfillment. [Functions reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions).
- Each operation (payment, inventory, email) is a durable **[Step](/concepts/steps)**, ensuring reliability and preventing duplicate actions if retries occur. [Steps reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows).
- **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)** (concurrency and rate limits) protects your payment gateway and database from being overwhelmed, especially during peak sales periods. [Flow Control reference](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control).
