# Core Concepts

Understanding Inngest's core concepts is the key to building reliable, scalable workflows. Each concept builds on the others to create a powerful system that eliminates the complexity of traditional [background job processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_queue) and [message queue systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue).

## Building Blocks
Inngest's core concepts work together to create reliable, [event-driven workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture):

1. **[Events](/concepts/events)** are triggers that notify your system when something happens, like a user signup or order placement. They decouple your application code from background processing and follow [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) principles.

2. **[Functions](/concepts/functions)** contain your business logic and respond to events automatically. They orchestrate multi-step workflows while handling [retries](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/retries) and state management using [durable execution](https://temporal.io/blog/what-is-durable-execution) patterns.

3. **[Steps](/concepts/steps)** break functions into [checkpoints](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#how-steps-work) that never re-execute if successful. This prevents duplicate work and ensures reliability when failures occur, implementing [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) concepts.

4. **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)** manages how your functions execute at scale through [concurrency limits](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/flow-control), [rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting), and [batching](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/flow-control#batching-events) to protect downstream systems. <br/> <br/>

| Concept | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **[Events](/concepts/events)** | The triggers that start everything | Decouple your app from background jobs |
| **[Functions](/concepts/functions)** | Where your business logic lives | Orchestrate workflows and respond to events |
| **[Steps](/concepts/steps)** | Checkpoints that make functions durable | Avoid re-work when failures happen |
| **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)** | Controls how functions execute at scale | Protect your infrastructure and APIs |

## How They Work Together
Here's a complete example showing all concepts in action:

```typescript
// 1. EVENT: User places an order
await inngest.send({
  name: "order/created",
  data: { orderId: "123", userId: "456", total: 99.99 }
});

// 2. FUNCTION: Process the order
export const processOrder = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "process-order",
    // 4. FLOW CONTROL: Limit concurrent executions
    concurrency: { limit: 5 }
  },
  { event: "order/created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // 3. STEPS: Durable workflow with checkpoints
    const payment = await step.run("process-payment", () =>
      stripe.charges.create({ amount: event.data.total })
    );

    const shipment = await step.run("create-shipment", () =>
      shipping.create({ orderId: event.data.orderId })
    );

    await step.run("send-confirmation", () =>
      email.sendConfirmation(event.data.userId, { payment, shipment })
    );
  }
);
```

In this example:
- **[Event](/concepts/events)** triggers the workflow when an order is created
- **[Function](/concepts/functions)** orchestrates the entire order process
- **[Steps](/concepts/steps)** ensure each operation is durable and can be retried independently  
- **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)** prevents overwhelming payment and shipping APIs

## Example Workflows

### E-commerce Order Processing
1. **[Events](/concepts/events)**: `order/created`, `payment/completed`, `shipment/delivered`
2. **[Functions](/concepts/functions)**: Order processing, inventory updates, customer notifications
3. **[Steps](/concepts/steps)**: Payment → inventory → shipping → notifications
4. **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)**: [Rate limiting](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/flow-control#rate-limiting) for payment APIs, [concurrency](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/flow-control#concurrency) for inventory

*See full implementation: [E-commerce Order Processing Example](/quick-start/examples#e-commerce-order-processing)*

### SaaS User Onboarding
1. **[Events](/concepts/events)**: `user/signup`, `subscription/created`, `usage/tracked`
2. **[Functions](/concepts/functions)**: User onboarding, billing, feature usage analysis
3. **[Steps](/concepts/steps)**: Multi-day onboarding sequences, retry failed charges
4. **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)**: Per-tenant limits, [batch processing](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/flow-control#batching-events) analytics

*See full implementation: [User Onboarding Sequence Example](/quick-start/examples#user-onboarding-sequence)*

### Content Moderation Pipeline
1. **[Events](/concepts/events)**: `content/uploaded`, `moderation/required`, `user/reported`
2. **[Functions](/concepts/functions)**: Content processing, moderation workflows, notifications
3. **[Steps](/concepts/steps)**: AI analysis → human review → publish/reject
4. **[Flow Control](/concepts/flow-control)**: Concurrency for AI APIs, batch processing uploads

*See full implementation: [Content Moderation Pipeline Example](/quick-start/examples#content-moderation-pipeline)*
