# Flow Control

Flow Control in Inngest provides sophisticated execution management that scales with your application - from simple rate limiting to complex multi-tenant orchestration. Instead of manually managing [worker pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool) and [queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue), you declare your constraints and Inngest enforces them intelligently. This ensures your functions operate reliably, protect downstream services, and manage costs effectively. [See official Flow Control Overview](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/flow-control). <br/> <br/>

## Core Concepts

Flow Control solves critical production challenges that arise when applications scale beyond simple use cases. Without proper flow control, your functions can overwhelm external APIs (leading to errors or blocks), consume excessive resources (increasing costs), or create unfair resource distribution across users (impacting user experience). Understanding these challenges helps you choose the right flow control mechanisms for your specific needs.

- **Traffic spikes** overwhelming external APIs ([Solution: Rate Limiting](/concepts/flow-control#rate-limiting), [Concurrency](/concepts/flow-control#concurrency-control))
- **Resource contention** when multiple functions compete ([Solution: Concurrency Keys](/concepts/flow-control#concurrency-keys-multi-tenant-concurrency))
- **Rate limits** from third-party services causing failures ([Solution: Rate Limiting](/concepts/flow-control#rate-limiting))
- **Cost escalation** from excessive function executions ([Solution: Debouncing](/concepts/flow-control#debouncing), [Batching](/concepts/flow-control#event-batching))
- **Unfair resource distribution** in multi-tenant applications ([Solution: Concurrency Keys](/concepts/flow-control#concurrency-keys-multi-tenant-concurrency))

## Concurrency Control

Limit how many function instances run simultaneously to protect your resources and manage load. Concurrency limits prevent your functions from overwhelming databases, third-party APIs, or internal services. This is crucial for maintaining system stability and ensuring fair resource access. [See official Concurrency Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/concurrency).

### Global Concurrency
Set a maximum number of instances for a specific function across your entire system. This is useful for functions that interact with resources having a global capacity limit.

```typescript
// Only 10 instances of this function can run at once, globally
export const processGlobalResource = inngest.createFunction(
  { 
    id: "process-global-resource",
    concurrency: { limit: 10 } // SDK Ref: https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/concurrency
  },
  { event: "resource/request" },
  async ({ event, step }) => { /* ... */ }
);
```

### Concurrency Keys (Multi-Tenant Concurrency)
Limit concurrency based on a specific key from the event data, often `event.data.userId` or `event.data.tenantId`. This ensures fairness in multi-tenant systems, preventing one busy user from consuming all available resources for a function. [See official Concurrency Keys Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/concurrency#concurrency-keys-multi-tenant-concurrency).

```typescript
// Max 2 concurrent instances per user for this function
export const processUserAction = inngest.createFunction(
  { 
    id: "process-user-action",
    concurrency: {
      limit: 2,
      key: "event.data.userId" // Limits per unique userId
    }
  },
  { event: "user/action" },
  async ({ event, step }) => { /* ... */ }
);
```

### Dynamic Concurrency
Adjust concurrency limits dynamically based on external factors or system load. This advanced pattern allows your system to adapt to changing conditions, but requires careful implementation usually involving an external system to manage the limit. ([Inngest Enterprise Feature](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/concurrency#dynamic-concurrency) or custom implementation needed).

## Rate Limiting

Control how frequently a function can execute over a given time period. Rate limiting protects external APIs from being overwhelmed, helps manage costs associated with API usage, and ensures compliance with third-party service limits. [See official Rate Limiting Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/rate-limiting).

### Global Rate Limiting
Limit the total number of executions for a specific function across your entire system within a defined time window.

```typescript
// Max 100 executions per hour for this function, globally
export const callThirdPartyApi = inngest.createFunction(
  { 
    id: "call-third-party",
    rateLimit: { 
      limit: 100, 
      period: "1h" // "1s", "1m", "1h", "1d"
    } // SDK Ref: https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/rate-limit
  },
  { event: "api/request" },
  async ({ event, step }) => { /* ... */ }
);
```

### Key-Based Rate Limiting
Limit execution frequency based on a specific key from the event data. This is useful for enforcing per-user or per-API-key rate limits for external services. [See official Keyed Rate Limiting Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/rate-limiting#key-based-rate-limiting).

```typescript
// Max 5 executions per minute per API key for this function
export const processApiRequest = inngest.createFunction(
  { 
    id: "process-api-request",
    rateLimit: {
      limit: 5,
      period: "1m",
      key: "event.data.apiKey"
    }
  },
  { event: "external/api_call" },
  async ({ event, step }) => { /* ... */ }
);
```

## Event Batching

Process multiple events together in a single function execution to improve efficiency and reduce costs, especially when interacting with APIs that support batch operations or when performing database updates. Events are collected until a maximum batch size or a timeout is reached. [See official Batching Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/batching).

```typescript
// Batch up to 50 events or wait 10 seconds, whichever comes first
export const updateUserAnalytics = inngest.createFunction(
  { 
    id: "update-user-analytics",
    batchEvents: { 
      maxSize: 50, 
      timeout: "10s" 
    } // SDK Ref: https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/batch-events
  },
  { event: "user/activity" },
  async ({ events, step }) => { // Note: `events` is an array
    const userData = events.map(event => event.data);
    await step.run("batch-update-analytics", () => 
      analyticsApi.batchUpdate(userData)
    );
  }
);
```

## Debouncing

Ensure a function only runs after a period of inactivity for events with the same key. This is useful for scenarios like auto-saving drafts, where you only want to trigger the save after the user has stopped typing for a certain duration. [See official Debouncing Guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/debounce).

```typescript
// Only run if no "draft/updated" event with the same docId is received for 5s
export const autoSaveDraft = inngest.createFunction(
  { 
    id: "auto-save-draft",
    debounce: { 
      period: "5s",
      key: "event.data.documentId"
    } // SDK Ref: https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/debounce
  },
  { event: "draft/updated" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("save-draft", () => 
      db.drafts.save(event.data.documentId, event.data.content)
    );
  }
);
```

## Advanced Patterns

Combine these core mechanisms to create more sophisticated flow control strategies.

### Priority Queues
While Inngest doesn't have explicit priority queues in its community offering, you can simulate priority by having separate functions with different [concurrency](/concepts/flow-control#concurrency-control) or [rate limits](/concepts/flow-control#rate-limiting) for high vs. low priority events, or by using different event names and function triggers. For dedicated priority queue features, see [Inngest Enterprise features](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/priority).

### Throttling & Backpressure
Use a combination of [concurrency limits](/concepts/flow-control#concurrency-control) and [rate limits](/concepts/flow-control#rate-limiting) to implement effective throttling and manage [backpressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure) on your systems. This ensures that your application remains stable and responsive even during sudden bursts of traffic.

### Circuit Breakers
Implement [circuit breaker patterns](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html) by using `step.run()` with custom error handling to detect repeated failures to an external service. You can then use `step.sleep()` to pause calls to that service for a period, or `step.sendEvent()` to flag the service as unhealthy. [See error handling patterns](/quick-start/patterns#error-handling-in-steps).

## Choosing the Right Mechanism

- **Use Concurrency**: To protect shared resources (databases, internal services) from being overloaded by too many simultaneous operations.
- **Use Rate Limiting**: To protect external APIs with usage quotas or to manage costs associated with per-call billing.
- **Use Batching**: To improve efficiency and reduce costs when APIs support batch operations or for bulk database writes.
- **Use Debouncing**: To trigger actions only after a period of inactivity, common for auto-save or notification coalescing.

## Observability

Monitor your flow control settings and their impact using the [Inngest Dashboard](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor). View function execution timelines, concurrency utilization, rate limit statuses, and batch processing metrics to fine-tune your configurations. [See Observability Metrics](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics).

## Best Practices

1.  **Start with sensible defaults**: Don't over-optimize flow control initially. Apply limits where you anticipate bottlenecks or have known external constraints.
2.  **Monitor and adjust**: Use the [Inngest dashboard](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/monitor) to observe how your limits are affecting function execution and adjust as needed.
3.  **Use keys effectively**: For multi-tenant systems, `event.data.userId` or `event.data.tenantId` are common and effective keys for fair resource distribution.
4.  **Communicate with API providers**: Understand the rate limits of third-party services you integrate with.
