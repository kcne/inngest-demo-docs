# Introduction

**Inngest** transforms the way developers build reliable background jobs and workflows. Instead of wrestling with queues, workers, and infrastructure, you write simple functions that automatically become durable, scalable workflows.

## What is Inngest?
**Inngest** is an **[event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) [durable execution](https://temporal.io/blog/what-is-durable-execution) platform** that combines two powerful concepts:

**[Event-Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)**: Your application sends [events](/concepts/events) when things happen (user signup, order placed, file uploaded). [Functions](/concepts/functions) automatically trigger in response to these events.

**[Durable Execution](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#durable-execution)**: Functions are broken into [steps](/concepts/steps) that create checkpoints. If something fails, only the failed step retries - successful steps never re-run. <br/><br/>

```typescript
export const processOrder = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-order" },
  { event: "order/created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Each step creates a checkpoint
    const payment = await step.run("charge-card", () => 
      stripe.charges.create(event.data.payment)
    );
    
    const shipment = await step.run("create-shipment", () => 
      shipping.create(event.data.items)
    );
    
    // If shipment fails, payment doesn't re-run
    await step.run("send-confirmation", () => 
      email.send(event.data.customerEmail, { payment, shipment })
    );
  }
);
```

## Why Inngest?

| Benefit | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|
| **Less Code** | Traditional background job systems require 100+ lines of boilerplate. Inngest functions are just regular TypeScript. |
| **Built-in Reliability** | Automatic retries with exponential backoff â€¢ State persistence across failures â€¢ Exactly-once execution â€¢ Built-in observability |
| **Scale Without Complexity** | Serverless-first (runs anywhere) â€¢ Flow control (concurrency, rate limiting, batching) â€¢ Multi-tenant isolation â€¢ Cost optimization |
| **Developer Experience** | TypeScript-first with full type safety â€¢ Local development with Dev Server â€¢ Visual debugging â€¢ Version control friendly |
