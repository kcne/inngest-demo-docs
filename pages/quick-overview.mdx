# Quick Overview

**Inngest** transforms background jobs from a complex infrastructure problem into simple code you write and deploy anywhere. Traditional [background job systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_queue) require you to manage [queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue), workers, job persistence, and retry logic separately from your application code.

**Inngest** takes a different approach: write TypeScript functions that respond to [events](/concepts/events), and Inngest handles the reliability, retries, and state management. Your functions become [durable workflows](https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-durable-execution) automatically - no queues to configure, no workers to manage. <br/><br/>

## The Inngest Approach

Instead of managing [queues](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/queues/), workers, and job state, you write **[TypeScript functions](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/typescript)** that become **[durable workflows](/concepts/steps)** automatically.

### Before Inngest

```typescript
// Complex setup with Redis, Bull queues, worker processes
const Queue = require('bull');
const emailQueue = new Queue('email');

// Job producer
emailQueue.add('welcome-email', { userId: 123 });

// Separate worker process 
emailQueue.process('welcome-email', async (job) => {
  // If this fails, start over from scratch
  const user = await db.users.findById(job.data.userId);
  await emailService.send(user.email, 'welcome');
  await analytics.track('email_sent', { userId: user.id });
});
```

### After Inngest

```typescript
// Just write your business logic
export const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-welcome-email" }, 
  { event: "user/signup" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Each step is automatically retried and memoized
    const user = await step.run("fetch-user", () =>
      db.users.findById(event.data.userId)
    );

    await step.run("send-email", () =>
      emailService.send(user.email, "welcome")
    );

    await step.run("track-event", () =>
      analytics.track("email_sent", { userId: user.id })
    );
  }
);
```

**The key difference**: In traditional systems, if any part of your job fails, the entire job restarts from the beginning. With Inngest's [step-based approach](/concepts/steps), each `step.run()` creates a [checkpoint](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#how-steps-work). If step 2 fails, only step 2 retries - steps 1 and 3 never re-execute because their results are already saved.

This means no duplicate emails, no double charges, and no wasted work. Your functions pick up exactly where they left off.

### Key Differences Summarized

Here's a breakdown of the advantages Inngest offers over traditional background job systems:

*   **Simplified Setup**: Eliminates the need for manual queue configuration (e.g., BullMQ, Redis) and separate worker processes.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate**: Write less code and focus purely on your business logic within Inngest functions, rather than extensive setup for queues and workers.
*   **Durable Steps & Checkpoints**: Each `step.run()` call within an Inngest function acts as a durable checkpoint.
*   **Granular Retries**: If a specific step fails, *only that step* is retried. Successfully completed preceding steps are never re-executed, preventing common issues like duplicate charges or repeated emails.
*   **Automatic State Management**: Inngest transparently handles state persistence across retries and between steps.
*   **Enhanced Reliability**: Workflows automatically resume from the point of failure, significantly improving the robustness of your background processes.

  **Pro Tip**: The `step.run()` approach isn't just about cleaner code; it fundamentally changes retry behavior. Only the *failed part* of your logic reruns, saving processing time and preventing duplicate operations on work that has already succeeded!

## How does it work

Inngest combines **[Event Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)** with **[Durable Execution](https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-durable-execution)**: [Events](/concepts/events) from your app trigger [functions](/concepts/functions) automatically, while [steps](/concepts/steps) inside those functions create checkpoints for reliability. This means your workflows respond to real-time events but can survive failures and recover gracefully.

#### Events Trigger Functions

Your app emit [events](/concepts/events) when things happen:

```typescript
// In your API routes, webhooks, or anywhere
await inngest.send({ //
  name: "user/signup",
  data: { userId: 123, email: "jane@example.com", plan: "pro" }
});
```

[Functions](/concepts/functions) automatically trigger in response:

```typescript
// This runs when user/signup events are sent
export const welcomeSequence = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "welcome-sequence" },
  { event: "user/signup" }, //
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Multi-step workflow that can span days
    await step.run("send-welcome", () => sendWelcome(event.data));
    await step.sleep("wait-1-day", "1d"); 
    await step.run("send-tips", () => sendTips(event.data));
    await step.sleep("wait-3-days", "3d");
    await step.run("check-engagement", () => checkEngagement(event.data));
  }
);
```

#### Functions Become Durable Workflows

Each `step.run()` creates a **[checkpoint](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows#how-steps-work)**. If anything fails:
- âœ… Successful steps never re-execute ([Memoization](/concepts/steps#memoization))
- ðŸ”„ Failed steps [retry automatically](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries) with [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)
- ðŸ’¾ State persists between retries and across infrastructure changes ([Durable Execution](https://www.inngest.com/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed))

#### Deploy Anywhere, Sync with Inngest

Your functions live in your codebase and [deploy with your app](https://www.inngest.com/docs/deploy):

```typescript
// app/api/inngest/route.ts (Next.js example)
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { welcomeSequence, processPayment } from "./functions";

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [welcomeSequence, processPayment]
});
```

After deployment, [sync your app with Inngest Cloud](https://www.inngest.com/docs/apps/cloud):

```bash
# Automatic with integrations (Vercel, Netlify)
# Or manual sync via curl
curl -X PUT https://your-app.com/api/inngest
```
